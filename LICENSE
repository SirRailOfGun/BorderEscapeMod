[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
10
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
11
 the version number 2.1.]

                            Preamble
14
​
15
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
16
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
17
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
18
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
19
​
20
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
21
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
22
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
23
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
24
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
25
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
26
​
27
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
28
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
29
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
30
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
31
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
32
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
33
these things.
34
​
35
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
36
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
37
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
38
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
39
​
40
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
41
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
42
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
43
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
44
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
45
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
